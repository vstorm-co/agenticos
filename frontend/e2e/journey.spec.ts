/**
 * One agent, from a stored key to a run with a cost against it.
 *
 * Every other spec checks one page in isolation, which is exactly where a
 * platform like this breaks: each part passes its own tests while the seams
 * between them rot. This is the only test that proves a key stored in the vault
 * is the key a model resolves, that a model created in the Builder is the model
 * a run bills against, that the run the chat started against the agent the
 * Builder published is the run Activity reports, and that a stranger with the
 * hosted link reaches that same frozen version (#517).
 *
 * The model that answers is `e2e/stub-model-server.ts`, an OpenAI-compatible
 * server Playwright starts beside the app. That is not a compromise for cost -
 * it is what makes this runnable at all. It used to need a real provider key,
 * so it skipped itself in every environment that did not have one, which was
 * every environment including CI: the one test covering the seams was the one
 * test nobody ran.
 *
 * What the stub costs in coverage is worth naming. This no longer proves that
 * OpenAI answers, or that a real key is accepted - those are the provider's
 * business and would make a green suite depend on somebody else's uptime. What
 * it still proves is everything between: the endpoint reaches the resolver, the
 * profile's key is what the run is attributed to, the agent's *instructions*
 * reach the model request (the stub replies with the token they name, and
 * nothing else could put it there), the streaming path carries the answer to the
 * browser, and the usage that came back is metered into a cost.
