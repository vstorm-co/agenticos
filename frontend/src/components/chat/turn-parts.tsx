/**
 * A turn's body: its reasoning, its work and its words, in the order they arrived.
 *
 * Extracted out of `MessageItem` so the hosted page renders the *same* turn rather
 * than a second interpretation of one. The page had its own: a `whitespace-pre-wrap`
 * bubble for the answer, an italic paragraph for the reasoning and a bare label per
 * tool call - which is three renderers to keep in step with these, and the #144
 * defect waiting to happen again.
 *
 * What stayed in `MessageItem` is everything about being a *member*: the avatar and
 * the account behind it, the agent's name and version, the cost, the rating buttons,
 * regenerate, the sources panel and the attachments a signed-in reader may open.
 * None of it belongs on a public page, which is the whole reason the split falls
 * here.
 *
 * `mcpServers` is passed rather than fetched, and that is what makes the component
 * usable on both surfaces: the servers turn `linear_create_issue` into
 * "Linear · Create issue", and reading them from the API inside the step would be
 * two authenticated queries on a page where nobody is signed in - and there is no
 * query client on that route to run them.
