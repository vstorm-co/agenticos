"""Tests for expiring a tool call nobody decided.

An approval waits on a person, so nothing in a request path can end one: the
whole point is that no request is coming. That leaves a schedule, and a schedule
is the one caller here with no tenant and no actor - which is what most of these
tests are about. What it writes has to be a denial by timeout on the *run*, in
the row's own organization, saying plainly that nobody decided.
