"""`run_coding_agent`, and the text the model reads about it.

One tool, because there is one thing to do: hand a task to Claude Code or Codex
and let it work. What it may do there - read and answer, or change files and run
commands - is the binding's `access`, decided by whoever built the agent rather
than chosen by the model call by call, and whether a person says yes first is
the binding's approval, like any other tool's.

A conversation's tasks continue a harness session by name: the session id is kept
beside the work, so the second task in a chat knows what the first read without
the model carrying ids around. Several named sessions run side by side - two
projects, or both harnesses on the person's computer - and `fresh_session` starts
one over.
