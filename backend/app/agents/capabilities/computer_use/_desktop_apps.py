One implementation for every Linux desktop computer use drives. A sandbox runs
this file's source with `python3 -c`, and the computerd image copies it in

desktop's own account, which is whose menu it reads.

Run as a script: `list` prints the applications as JSON, and `launch <app>`
opens the one with that name or id and waits for its window. A refusal is a
