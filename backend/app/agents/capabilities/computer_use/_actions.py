"""What the model may do to a desktop, and the one place coordinates are scaled.

The model sees a screenshot no larger than the capability's bound - a 1280x800
picture of a 2560x1600 Retina screen, say - and answers in that picture's pixels.
Every backend takes coordinates in its *own* input space: X11 pixels on Linux,
points on macOS. So a click is translated exactly once, here, by the factor the
screenshot was shrunk by, and no backend has to know the model saw anything else.
