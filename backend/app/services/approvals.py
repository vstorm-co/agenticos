"""Human approval for side-effecting tool calls.

The difference between a demo and something a company lets near its systems. An
agent that can send an email, refund a payment or write to a CRM should not be
able to do so unattended just because nobody set a flag - so approval is the
default for anything marked side-effecting, and waiving it is an explicit act
recorded in the spec.

What is stored is the tool *and its arguments*: approving "send_email" without
seeing the recipient is a rubber stamp, and replaying the stored arguments means
the model cannot change its mind between asking and acting.

        Called from the run's terminal write rather than from inside a tool call,
        so it takes ids rather than an auth context - the agent, not a member, is
        what asks - and one of those ids is the row's own. The id is allocated when
        the call is parked (see :class:`~app.services.agent_runner.ParkedApproval`)
        because parking a call must not touch the shared session, so the row it
        names is written afterwards and cannot let the database mint the id.

        Args:
            approval_id: The row's id, already handed to the surface and stored in
                the run's `paused_state`, so the write cannot mint a second one.
            agent_id: The agent whose run this is, which is what scopes the row.
            capability_tool_id: The stable id of the tool `tool_id` names, which a
                binding may have renamed, so a surface words the call by the tool
                and not by its name. `None` for a tool no capability owns.
            context: The arguments' ids as names, from the tool's describer, for
                the card and the queue to read. `None` when the tool has none or
                describing it failed - the call is asked about either way.
            account: Which account of an MCP service the call acts as, where its
                binding names one - "Send mail" from which of two mailboxes.
            subagent_name: Which delegate is acting, when the call came from inside
                a delegation. A delegate's gated tool reaches the run's own approval
                channel, so without this the queue says `send_email` without saying
                who is sending it - and a reviewer with only a tool name in front of
                them is a reviewer approving blind.
            subagent_agent_id: That delegate's own agent, or `None` for an inline
                specialist, which has no agent of its own to name.
            standing_consent_by: Who granted this call in advance, for a chat
                session running under `ApprovalMode.APPROVE_ALL`. The row is
                written `approved` and names them, because a waived run has to be

        ceiling, and a person looking at run history sees work that is neither
        finished nor going to be. So each expired call is followed down to the
        run behind it, and the run is ended.

        `cancelled` rather than a status of its own. Nobody came back, and that
