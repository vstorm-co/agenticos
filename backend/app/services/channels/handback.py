"""Who continues a parked chat run, and what a chat is told when one ends (#2656).

A run started in Slack, Telegram, Mattermost, Teams or Discord can be decided
somewhere else: the console, the web chat, the session API. The run then belongs
to the chat it was asked in, and that chat hears about the outcome. This module
holds the one predicate that says so, the fixed sentences a chat is told when a
run ends without an answer, and the plain post that carries them.

A notice is never built from a refusal message or from run data. The four
sentences below are the whole vocabulary; a chat room is not a place to explain
who was refused or why.
