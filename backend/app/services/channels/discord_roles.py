"""Reconciling a linked Discord member's memberships with the roles they hold (#2569).

An organization's Discord role mappings are read against the roles each of its
bots reports for the person's linked Discord accounts, and the person's
*Discord-managed* memberships are made to match: admitted with the mapped role
where a mapping names one, put in the mapped groups, and taken out again where
no mapping matches any more. The directory sync's rules hold here unchanged:

- **Only a linked account counts.** An unlinked Discord user is nobody on the
  deployment, so no role of theirs can make them a member.
- **The sync touches only rows it made** (`source = discord`). A membership an
  administrator made or took over keeps its role, and a group membership added
  by hand stays when the role is taken away. Directory rows are the directory
  sync's.
- **An owner is never demoted or removed by it**, and no mapping can name
  `owner`.
- **A personal organization is never joined** - `list_for_org` excludes them.
- **Not knowing is not losing.** When Discord cannot be asked about a server -
  a revoked token, an outage - what that server's mappings gave is kept. Only
  Discord's own answer that the account is not in the server, or the bot no
  longer is, takes the roles away. One unreadable server does not hold up the
  others: what the servers that answered say is applied.

It runs at two moments: before each turn the person takes with a bot of the
organization, in that turn's transaction, so somebody given `@Finance` a moment
ago is answered as Finance; and from the periodic `sync-discord-roles` sweep,
which looks again at everybody it placed, because whoever left the server stops
talking to the bot and their next turn never comes. Discord can push a member's
role changes as they happen, but only to a bot holding the privileged Server
Members Intent, which a bot here does not request.
