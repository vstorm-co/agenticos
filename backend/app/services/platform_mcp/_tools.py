"""The platform's operations: the public API, one call each.

The MCP server registers them for Claude Code, any MCP client (#2058) and the
in-app AI Architect, which reaches the same server in-process (#2063) - so there
is one name, one description and one call for every caller.

Every description names the permission the call needs, because the caller's key
or token decides what succeeds and a model told up front stops asking for what
it will be refused. Nothing here touches a credential. What deletes is undoing an
agent draft its caller owns and never published, and removing a routine; what
publishes is `publish_agent`, held for the person's approval like every write
here but `UNGATED` (#2301).
