"""Scheduling an agent to run itself - the service behind agent triggers.

A trigger fires an agent on a schedule, with nobody at the keyboard. Everything
about *what* a run is - its budget, its approvals, its accounting - is unchanged,
because a fired run goes through the same
:meth:`app.services.agent_runner.AgentRunnerService.execute` every other surface
does. This service owns the two halves the runner does not: deciding a trigger is
due without two heartbeats firing it twice, and deciding whom a fired run runs as.

Who may *create* a trigger is `agents:run` **on that agent**, resolved per-resource
through :class:`app.services.agent_registry.AgentRegistryService` - the same grant
-aware check the run path itself makes, not a role gate. Creating a schedule is
asserting "run this agent, repeatedly, as me", so the floor is exactly the
permission to run it once.

Managing an *existing* trigger is stricter, because a trigger runs its stored
prompt with its creator's identity and sandbox. The creator manages their own with
that same `agents:run`; managing someone else's - editing its prompt, deleting it,
firing it now - needs `agents:edit` on the agent, so a member who could merely run
the agent cannot edit another member's trigger into exfiltrating that member's
files. See :meth:`AgentTriggerService._owned`.

Whom a fired run runs *as* is the trigger's creator, re-resolved every fire, the
way a channel mention runs as its sender and an embed widget as its owner. There
is no invented service user: a run nobody can be held to is the thing
:class:`app.core.permissions.AuthContext` refuses to mint. When the creator can no
longer run the agent - they left the organization, or their grant on it was
revoked - the trigger auto-disables and an audit entry records why, rather than
retrying a refusal for ever.

        Works for either kind, and is deliberately offered on both. A schedule
        fires one extra time with `next_fire_at` left untouched - running now is an
        extra fire, not a reschedule. An **event trigger** fires too, as a manual
        test-fire: the agent runs its base prompt with no delivery context
        (`event_context=None`), so it is the way to confirm the agent, its prompt
        and its budget behave without standing up a provider, signing a payload or
        waiting for a real delivery. What it does *not* exercise is the signature
        path or a real payload's rendered context.

        The caller needs `agents:run` on the agent - the floor for scheduling it
        at all, checked by `_owned`. The fire runs as the trigger's creator, the
        same subject a heartbeat or a delivered event uses, so a trigger always
        runs as one identity however it was set off. A paused trigger is respected
        - `fire` no-ops on an inactive one - so this is offered only on a live one.

        The run itself is attributed to the creator, but *who pressed the button*
        is a separate fact and a spend, so it is audited under the caller: without
        this, a member with `agents:run` could set off a run recorded entirely
        under someone else's name.

        **The fire is dispatched, not awaited** (#658). Awaiting it ran the whole
        agent inside the HTTP request, so an agent slower than a proxy's read
        timeout - 60s by default on nginx - answered the caller 504 while the run
        carried on and committed server-side: a failure reported for something that
        was working, and an invitation to press the button again and fire the
        schedule twice. It is queued as a `fire-trigger` job - the same durable,
        capped door the heartbeat and the webhook path use - rather than an
        in-process task, because the 202 is a promise: a task living in the API
        process is lost with the process (a restart, a deploy, an exceeded drain
        timeout), leaving the caller polling for a `last_run_id` that will never
        arrive. The job is written in this request's transaction, so it exists
        exactly when the audit entry beside it does, and a worker runs it.

        Returns the trigger as it stands, which is why the route answers 202: the
        run has not happened yet, so `last_run_id` still names the previous one. The
        fire appends to the trigger's run-log conversation as it goes.

        secret per installation, so a delivery carries an `installation.id` and a
        `repository.full_name` and the routing is a lookup rather than a path
        parameter.

        Three steps, in this order and for this reason:

        1. **Read the installation id out of the unverified body.** It selects
           candidate grants and authorises nothing; the signature is still what
           proves the delivery. Selecting the key to check with is the one thing
           that has to happen before the check.
        2. **Verify against that organization's own webhook secret.** A delivery
           whose signature matches no candidate is refused, exactly as a
           per-trigger one is, because a misconfigured secret is the integrator's
           to fix and GitHub surfaces a 403.

           repository. One event firing several triggers is the polled shape, not
           the per-URL one - and it is correct here: two triggers on the same
           repository is what the presets invite.

        The worker calls this with no auth context - it is a system sweep, and the
        organization each fired run belongs to is read off its own row.

        Only `next_fire_at` moves here, not `last_fired_at`: claiming is not
        firing, and the dispatched run may still be refused (a creator who lost
        access). The actual fire stamps `last_fired_at` in `fire`, so it means the
        same thing - a run was created - on every entry path, scheduled or event.

        An orphaned schedule - one whose creator's user row was hard-deleted, so
        `created_by_user_id` is null - is claimed now (the query no longer filters
        it out) and disabled here rather than dispatched: it can never run, and
        `fire` would only disable it after a wasted job. Firing is left to the
        schedules that can still fire.

        The fire is queued in the claim's own transaction, so a trigger is never
        advanced without its run queued, nor queued twice: the two commit together.

        A trigger whose previous fire is still busy is claimed only when its
        `overlap` lets it be (`claim_due`), and then: `skip` advances past the
        occurrence without firing; `allow` fires with no claim ticket, as
        `run_now` does, leaving the marker to the fire still relying on it.
        Returns the triggers that fired.

        """Run the agent this trigger fires, as the member who created it.

        Called by the worker with a bare id (a scheduled fire) or by the webhook's
        background task with the delivered `event_context` (an event fire), so it
        re-loads everything and trusts nothing from the caller: a trigger deleted
        or disabled between claim and fire simply does nothing. An event fire
        appends its context to the trigger's prompt, so the agent sees which issue
        or email set it off; a scheduled fire has none and sends the prompt as-is.
        The run goes through `AgentRunnerService.execute`,
        so a budget it cannot afford ends the run `BUDGET_EXCEEDED` and returns
        here normally - never raising, so the flow is not retried into spending
        the same organization's money again.

        A refusal from the authorization layer is treated the same way, but with a
        different cause: it means the creator can no longer run this agent, so the
        trigger is disabled rather than retried (the "silently retried refusal"
        #44 guards against, reached through the authz door instead of the budget
        one).

        A run that fails on something the runner re-raises rather than records - a
        provider 5xx, a revoked key, a timeout - is neither a refusal nor a reason
        to disable. `_run` has already committed the row as `failed`, so the fire
        is in Activity; `fire` recovers that row from the trigger's conversation to
        stamp `last_run_id` and returns, rather than letting the error fail the
        job and retry the same outage against the same money. The recovered
        row is identified by *this* fire having advanced the conversation's tail past
        the previous fire's run - an error before the run existed leaves the tail
        where it was, and stamping it would name the wrong fire.

        Only a durably recorded failure is swallowed. A run that reached a terminal
        state whose write never committed - a finalization or persistence step
        raising after the answer was in hand - is re-raised, so the half-written
        state rolls back and the flow is marked failed rather than reporting a run
        that no row records.

        `claimed_at` is the `fire_in_flight_since` the heartbeat's claim stamped, and
        it is this fire's claim ticket: passing it says "clear the marker when this
        ends - however it ends: a completed run, a recorded failure, a disable, or a
        skip - but only while the marker is still the one my claim set". Only the
        scheduled worker path passes it. `run_now` and an event fire reach `fire`
        with no claim behind them, and a marker they find belongs to a concurrent
        scheduled fire still relying on it: clearing it would reopen the trigger to
        the next tick mid-run, the self-overlap `0051_trigger_fire_in_flight` exists to close.

        The identity check is what keeps a slow fire from clearing a *newer* claim's
        marker. If this fire outran the lease, `claim_due` may have re-claimed the
        trigger and stamped a fresh `fire_in_flight_since` for a second fire now in
        flight; this one finishing must not clear that, or the trigger reopens under
        the newer fire. So it clears only when the marker still equals the timestamp
        it was dispatched with. The lease still frees a marker a crashed scheduled
        fire never cleared, and a dispatch that never started a run leaves the marker
        for the lease to free rather than clearing it eagerly - the child flow may
        have started even when the submit call raised.

        While the run executes, the marker is *renewed* (`_keep_lease_alive`): a
        run longer than the lease is otherwise indistinguishable from a crashed
        one, and the next heartbeat would re-claim the trigger and fire it on
        top of itself. The run's own committed `running` row (#12) also blocks
        `claim_due` while it stands, but that row is bounded by the stale-run
        sweep rather than by liveness - a crashed fire's row reads `running`
        until the sweep ends it - so the renewed marker stays the signal that
        distinguishes a slow fire from a dead one. Each renewal moves the
        ticket, so the clear here names the timestamp the row actually holds.

        cross-resource reads: without them a caller could pass another agent's
        trigger id to an agent they can run and act on it.

        The third: a trigger runs its stored prompt with its *creator's* identity
        and sandbox, so editing, deleting or firing a trigger you did not create
        is an administrative act over someone else's authority, not the
        `agents:run` that merely lets you fire the agent as yourself. A member who
        could only run the agent would otherwise edit another member's trigger
        prompt - `prompt` is a writable field - and have it exfiltrate the
        creator's per-user files on the next delivery, or press *Run now* to do so
        at once. So managing a trigger the caller did not create needs
        `agents:edit` on the agent (an org admin, or the holder of an explicit edit
        grant); the creator manages their own with the `agents:run` they built it
        on. A refusal is reported as "not found", the same unprobeable answer the
